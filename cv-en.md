## Education

# October 2014 - Present

PhD in Mathematics, Cardiff University.  
Supervisors: Prof. Paul Harper & Dr. Vincent Knight

This is a project in Operational Research, where I am researching queueing networks and their applications to healthcare systems. The work has focused on open restricted queueing networks and their deadlocking properties. A graph theoretical method of detecting when deadlock occurs in computer simulations was found and implemented. Markov models of deadlocking simple one and two node queueing networks built, and investigations carried out into the time until deadlock is reached. These Markov chains have been extended to accomodate customers' baulking behaviour, and servers' scheduled vacations. Dynamic programming and reinforcement learning algorithms are being used to solve Markov Decision Processes, in order to find the optimal deadlock resolution policy for these queueing networks.

A central part of this project is the development and maintenence of an open source Python library for simulating queueing networks, [Ciw](https://github.com/CiwPython/Ciw) (with bilingual documentation available [here](http://ciw.readthedocs.io/).) Currently under development is a data visualisation tool for the results of these simulations, [CiwVis](https://ciwpython.github.io/CiwVis/).

# October 2013 - October 2014

MSc Operational Research and Applied Statistics, Cardiff University.

Here taught modules gave me an overview of operational research techniques including queueing theory, game theory, simulation, mathematical programming and heuristics. Statistical techniques learned include parametric and non-parametric hypotheses testing, and use of SPSS.
I completed my dissertation at the University of Twente in the Netherlands on an Erasmus placement.

Dissertation title: *Optimising surgery schedules in order to increase operating room utilisation and level beds in the PACU and holding area.*

## Skills

Python, LaTeX, VBA, Excel, SPSS, Simul8, HTML, CSS. I am currently learning JavaScript. I hold a full, clean driving license. Fluent in both English and Welsh.

## Other

I assist with lab sessions and marking for various modules of the MSc, undergraduate operational research modules, and the Computing for Mathematics module. I am also a maths and stats support tutor. I have also translated some materials from English to Welsh, such as class tests and coursework.

I was a co-steam-organiser of the Stochastic Modelling Stream at the Young OR 19 in Aston. I was member of the organising committee for [DjangoCon Europe 2015, Cardiff](http://2015.djangocon.eu/). I was also involved in teaching on a mathematics summer school for first year undergraduates at the University of Namibia, Windhoek, in January 2016.

I am a member of [The UK OR Society](https://www.theorsociety.com).

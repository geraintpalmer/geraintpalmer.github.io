[(Yn Gymraeg)](/teaching/addysg-cymraeg/)

A large part of my job is contributing to Welsh medium higher education at the
School of Mathematics.
Sometimes it's difficult to justify the reasons for doing this, and I feel that
many people have many differing opinions on why this is provided.
On this page I outline my personal perspective on Welsh medium higher education.
*This is my opinion only*.

The aim here is to map what we do to defintie School goals, and map those goals
to good reasons for having Welsh medium education, more than simply for its own
sake, or due to ideologies.
Therefore we can justify every activity or idea we have, to ourselves, to our
colleagues, and to out students, and to try and increase understanding about our
work.


## Reasons for Welsh medium higher education

The document Cymraeg 2050[^3] was published by the Welsh Government in 2017.
The document outlines the government's strategy for stimulating and supporting
the Welsh language, by working towards a target of having a million Welsh
speakers by the year 2050.
Even though this target is arbitrary, and some might see it as pointless or
artificial, the activities and interventions that occur along the way in order
to reach this target will improve the experiences of Welsh speakers and Welsh
services, in addition to enriching Welsh culture.

The strategy discusses three broad themes: increasing the number of Welsh
speakers, increasing the use of the language, and creating favourable conditions
for the language to thrive.
The second theme encompasses increasing the use of Welsh in the workplace, and
talks of the lack of post-16 teachers who speak Welsh.
The last theme concerns research, community, and technology.
The document notes where particular sectors can contribute, and it does mention
the role of higher education.
I believe we can think of a number of the issues listed in this document
(increasing the use of Welsh in the workplace, solving the lack of Welsh
speaking teachers, and improve Welsh technologies) as symptoms of the same
problem: that we need to increase proficiency in technical language in Welsh.

These aims are discussed further in the Welsh government's planning strategies.
The government's education planning document[^6] notes higher education's role
in supplying a teaching workforce with relevant language skills, and in
developing research into and concerning the Welsh language and Welsh language
education.
Our role in producing workers with mathematical, computational, and research
skills, in Welsh, is emphasised in the government's technology planning
document[^5].
The document notes a number of fields where there is a need for new Welsh
language technologies that links directly to our field of mathematics, including
machine learning and artificial intelligence for the Welsh language, coding
resources, and text-to-speech technologies for Welsh.

In addition to all this, the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol was established in 2011
(from the One Wales Delivery Plan[^4]), with the aim of ensuring every student
in Wales has the right to Welsh medium higher education of the highest
quality[^1].
They also note that the language of higher education needs to reflect the
language of the rest of the education system in Wales, that is no student should
have a disadvantage because of the language of their previous education (in
either direction: Welsh to English, or English to Welsh).

From these I have listed, in no particular order, reasons I believe are
applicable to us as a School on why we need Welsh medium higher education:

<ol type="A" style="font-weight: bold">
  <li><span style="font-weight: 300">Increasing proficiency in technical language in Welsh,</span></li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: 300">Supply the lack of post-16 teachers that speak Welsh,</span></li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: 300">Ensure that children don't lose the Welsh language after leaving school,</span></li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: 300">Increase the use of Welsh in the workplace,</span></li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: 300">Create or contribute to Welsh language communities,</span></li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: 300">Produce skilled workers that can build Welsh language digital infrastructure,</span></li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: 300">Produce skilled workers that can contribute to Welsh language research,</span></li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: 300">Ensure every student had the right to Welsh medium higher education,</span></li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: 300">Ensure students have no disadvantage due to the language of any aspect of their education.</span></li>
</ol>

I feel that we have been over-concentrating on reasons **H** and **I**, which
put the students themselves as the focus of the campaign for Welsh medium higher
education.
But if students do not feel there are disadvantages to studying in English (or
even that there is an advantage to studying in English), and don't want to
exercise their right to study in Welsh, then the campaign can be seen as
pointless, and that a lot of resources are given to the needs or whims of
students that might not exist.
However we should also be thinking of our bilingual graduates' place in the
nation, which give us a need to meet targets on numbers of students studying in
Welsh, beyond just the sustainability of the provision.

Some other reasons that are reported for studying through the medium of Welsh
are smaller class sizes, extra money, and better relationships with staff[^2].
These are true: there are scholarships available to students studying a certain
amount of credits in Welsh, Welsh tutorial classes are smaller, and usually it's
the same staff taking most tutorials and are also personal tutors to the
students, so relationships can strengthen.
But these are side-effects or something greater, and in my opinion are not
strong enough reasons for the provision or to attract students.
In addition by working towards developing the provision, these advantages could
disappear, for example by working to get more students taking Welsh modules
class sizes will increase.

Even more importantly I feel we are disadvantaging ourselves by forgetting about
many of these overarching reasons, and by failing to communicate these reasons
to our students.
We don't want our students to think they are studying Welsh modules because they
are not skilled enough to do them in English.
We also don't want them to think that other people think this about them (for
example non-Welsh speaking students and staff).
Therefore to avoid this it is important to communicate all the reasons on the
above list to everyone, Welsh speakers and non-Welsh speaking staff and
students.

I summarise this with the manta ''not because they can't do it in English, but
because they have the potential to do it in Welsh''.



## Aims, targets, and problems

As a School we provide Welsh medium education in order to work towards the
overarching national goals, some appropriate ones were listed in the previous
section.
Our work directly feeds into these these.
In order for us to direct our efforts correctly we have School targets, that can
map to these reasons.

Our own targets should reflect the School of Mathematics' potential to
contribute to the national goals and reasons for why we provide Welsh medium
higher education.
They also need to contribute to solving any barriers towards reaching these
goals.
Therefore I'll list some barriers I think have the potential to hold students
back:

<ol type="a" style="font-weight: bold">
  <li><span style='font-weight: 300'>There may be too much administrative effort for our students. For example by asking for bilingual exam papers early, booking a Welsh appointment at the mathematics support service, and generally understanding the overall Welsh provision at the School;</span></li>
  <li><span style='font-weight: 300'>Studying in Welsh might be, or seen to be, more difficult than studying in English for a number of reasons:
  <ol type="1" style='font-weight: bold'>
    <li><span style='font-weight: 300'>a smaller community, so less students to work with or ask for help,</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-weight: 300'>level of Welsh isn't as good as their English, or Welsh resources are more difficult to read,</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-weight: 300'>unfamiliar with the terminology or it doesn't come naturally,</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-weight: 300'>lack of Welsh language resources that are not directly connected to a module, for example textbooks, online video tutorials, academic journal articles, wikipedia articles, and so on,</span></li>
  </ol>
  </span></li>
  <li><span style='font-weight: 300'>Welsh provision can seem supplementary or to one side of the English provision, which is easy to forget about;</span></li>
  <li><span style='font-weight: 300'>There is no official / obvious recognition that they have followed a Welsh medium course, so any extra effort can seem pointless;</span></li>
  <li><span style='font-weight: 300'>Lack of motivation to partake in Welsh education, prehaps connected to a lack of understanding about why we offer Welsh education;</span></li>
  <li><span style='font-weight: 300'>Lack of ownership and pride over the provision, can be seen as something that happens to the students and not something they are doing themselves.</span></li>
</ol>

Due to these problems, and the overarching reasons given in the first section, I
suggest a number of targets, in addition to those set by the Coleg, that will
work towards these problems and also enrich our current students' experiences.

Specific targets set by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol:

<ol type="i">
  <li><b>Provide 40 credits per year through the medium of Welsh</b><br>
  This target feeds into reasons <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>,
  <b>G</b>, <b>H</b> and <b>I</b>, by ensuring that students have a choice of
  language, and that we offer technical skills bilingually.</li>
  <li><b>An average of 10 students each year studying Welsh modules</b><br>
  This target feeds into reasons <b>A-G</b>, by ensuring we are producing enough
  graduates with bilingual technical skills. It also ensures that the provision
  is sustainable.</li>
  <li><b>Three members of staff who contribute to Welsh medium education</b><br>
  This target feeds into reasons <b>D</b>, <b>E</b> and <b>I</b>, by ensuring we
  offer a diverse range of research interests, personalities and teaching
  methods, and by expanding the community of Welsh speakers in the
  department.</li>
</ol>

I suggest eight further targets that originate from the potential problems
above.
These additional targets are secondary to the three set by the Coleg, and their
main purpose for having them is to determine the direction of the development of
the provision, to help generate ideas, and to justify our work.

Additional suggested targets:

<ol type="i" start="4">
  <li><b>Improve proficiency in mathematical language</b><br>
    In essence this is the main reason for providing Welsh medium higher
    education, and it's easy to forget by only thinking of targets <b>i</b>,
    <b>ii</b> and <b>iii</b>. This target feeds into reasons <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
    <b>F</b> and <b>G</b> by producing graduates with the appropriate linguistic
    skills; while also trying to solve problems <b>b2</b> and <b>b3</b>, by
    easing the experiences of students studying in Welsh.</li>
  <li><b>Communicate reasons better</b><br>
    This target tries to solve problems <b>e</b>, <b>f</b> and maybe <b>c</b>,
    by motivating students to study in Welsh. It will also increase transparency
    in our work, maybe encouraging students to take part in our work (for
    example by working on projects and developing resources), and it could also
    strengthen relationships between students and staff.</li>
  <li><b>Develop and improve external resources</b><br>
    This target feeds into reasons <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b> and <b>I</b>;
    while also trying to solve problems <b>b2</b> and <b>b4</b>. Internal
    resources, for example lecture notes, are included in target <b>i</b>, but
    there is a very important place in a student's education for websites,
    textbooks, blogs, academic articles, and so on, when doing research projects
    and individual studies. This will also contribute towards a Welsh atmosphere
    while studying.</li>
  <li><b>Ease students' administrative work</b><br>
    This target feeds into reason <b>I</b>; and tries to solve problems <b>a</b>
    and <b>c</b>. The main thing to think about here is ensuring students
    receive bilingual exam papers as default, and ensures that the language is
    central to their studies.</li>
  <li><b>Develop a Welsh community within the School</b><br>
    This target feeds into reasons <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> and <b>E</b>; and tries to
    solve problems <b>b1</b>and <b>c</b>.</li>
  <li><b>Develop the School's place withing the Welsh community</b><br>
    This target feeds into reason <b>E</b>. It could also contribute to
    achieving target <b>ii</b>, by raising awareness of the provision and
    attracting students.</li>
  <li><b>Opportunities to give feedback on the provision</b><br>
    This target feeds into reason <b>E</b>; and tries to solve problems
    <b>c</b>, <b>e</b> and <b>f</b>. It will also enable us to continue to
    improve our provision as the environment and the problems we face change
    with time.</li>
  <li><b>Recognition that students have followed a Welsh medium course</b><br>
    Apart from the list of modules a student has completed, or receipt of a Coleg
    Cymraeg grant, there is no evidence that a student has followed a bilingual
    course. This target feeds into reasons <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b> and
    <b>G</b> by giving proof to the public and to employers that our students
    have developed their skills through the medium of Welsh. It also tries to
    solve problems <b>d</b>, <b>e</b> and <b>f</b> my providing a concrete
    myopic reason for students to study in Welsh.</li>
</ol>


This outlines my beliefs on Welsh medium higher education.
I hope it shows my enthusiasm doesn't stem from nationalist ideology, but it is
to align with government policies and to provide benefits to the students.

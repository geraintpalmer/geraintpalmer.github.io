Over the Summer I was successful in my application for on of the
[Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol's small grants](http://www.colegcymraeg.ac.uk/en/thecoleg/projects/smallgrants/) (Â£2500), to start a project entitled
"Creating Welsh Medium Multi-Media Programming Resources".
There were two main aims to the project, to teach and communicate computational
skills in Welsh to undergraduate and to postgraduate students.

For postgraduate students and project students, we developed a website that
curates and adapts resources on conducting reproducible computational research.
For undergraduate students, we developed a comprehensive video series that
teaches the Python programming language.
With the grant money we were able to take on a student,
[Stephanie Jones](https://twitter.com/stephangharad) from the School of
Mathematics in Cardiff, to develop and record the videos.


# The Aim

At the moment there is a shortage of open computing resources in Welsh.
We are hoping to begin to fill this shortage in order to:

 + Support the Welsh medium teaching of Python that is already happening in
 Welsh universities (e.g. in Cardiff and Aberystwyth universities, and others) -
 and so support Welsh medium higher education, and deepen theses students'
 experiences.
 + Develop coders and software engineers of the future who are comfirtable
 working bilingually.
 + Communicate computational skills in a more personal, accessible and
 appropriate way for the Welsh speaking community.


# The Produce

 + A comprehensive set of 28 videos that cover downloading, installing and
 running Python; basic syntax; and algorithmic thinking by solving example
 problems. The aim is for them to complement anc accompancy formal teaching in
 universities. There are available [here](/teaching/tiwtorialau-python) and

 + A Welsh language website that is part adapation of a
 [research software development workshop](https://vknight.org/rsd/), and part
 curation of resources on computational research skills. It includes topics such
 open research, automation skills, best practices in coding, and version
 control. This adaption to a website increases it's availability to the
 community of Welsh speaking researchers, and can also act as a reference
 resource. It is available here: [https://sgiliauymchwilcyfrifiadurol.github.io/](https://sgiliauymchwilcyfrifiadurol.github.io/)

Thank you very much to the Coleg Cymraeg for the opportunity to complete this
project, to Steph for her hard work, and to the School of Mathematics for their
support; and we hope that these resources will be of benefit to students.

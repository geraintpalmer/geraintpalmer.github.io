I had a disagreement with my Grampa this weekend.
He insists ['old money'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3sd) (pre-decimalisation) is much simpler than our current decimalised system.
And I find it so confusing!
I thought, there must be a away of measuring this.

I'll consider three coinage systems here (as fractions of their largest coin):

+ 'Old money', that is British pound sterling pre-decimalisation with the following coins: penny (1d), threepence (3d), sixpence (6d), shilling (12d), florin (24d), half crown (30d), crown (60d), and sovereign (£1 or 240d);[^1]
+ Euros (or British pound sterling post-decimalisation, as they have the same denominations) with the following coins: 1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, and €1 or 100c;
+ American dollars with the following coins: cent (1¢), nickel (5¢), dime (10¢), quarter (25¢), half-dollar (50¢), and a dollar ($1 or 100¢).

I'll compare these in three dimensions: *efficiency*, *availability*, and *complexity*. I'll use brute-force to evaluate these, using Python's `itertools` and `pandas` to analyse all possible coin combinations below the value of the currencies' largest coin.


# Efficiency

A common mathematical puzzle in coins is the [change-making problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem). That is, for a given value of money, what is the minimum number of coins needed to make this value.
This can usually be solved using linear programming or dynamic programming, but I use a brute force approach here.
For all possible values under their largest coin, we get:

Euros are by far the most efficient currency with pre-decimalised British money being the least efficient.


# Availability

Here I wanted to measure the currencies' robustness to running out of a certain denomination, and began to consider the well known mathematical puzzle of the [Frobenius coin problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem) (also known as the McNugget problem), when certain denominations were removed from the set.
This is a hard problem, though could be brute-forced in this case.

I simplified the problem by asking a similar question of what percentage of all possible values am I able to make out of $$n$$ coins?
We get:

Euros have a much higher availability than dollar, which in turn are more available than pre-decimalised British coins.


# Complexity

What did my Grampa originally mean by 'simpler'?
I'm not too sure, but we can measure complexity by considering coinage as a probabilistic problem:
assume there are $$\left\lfloor\frac{x_\text{max}}{x_i}\right\rfloor$$ of each denomination $$x$$, where $$x_\text{max}$$ is the value of the maximum coin.
This corresponds to all possible obtainable values less than $$x_\text{max}$$.
Let $$N$$ and $$V$$ be random variables representing a randomly chosen number of coins and a randomly chosen value to obtain, respectively.
Let $$\mathbb{P}(N=n, V=v)$$ be the probability of getting a value of $$v$$ with $$n$$ randomly chosen coins.

We can measure the [*Shannon entropy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) of each marginal distribution:

$$S_n = -\sum_v \mathbb{P}(V=v | N=n) \log_2 \mathbb{P}(V=v | N=n)$$

$$S_v = -\sum_n \mathbb{P}(N=n | V=v) \log_2 \mathbb{P}(N=n | V=v)$$

This can be thought of kind of like a measure of variance, but for nominal data (nominal here because we don't care how far away the values/numbers of coins are, just that they are different).

We get:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/complexity.png){: .center-image }

Here the American dollar is the least complex currency, closely followed by the Euro.
Pre-decimalised British coins display the largest amount of complexity of the three.

We can also measure the [*joint entropy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_entropy) of the distribution:

$$H(N, V) = -\sum_n \sum_v \mathbb{P}(N=n, V=v) \log_2 \mathbb{P}(N=n, V=v)$$

Measured jointly, Euros come out as the simplest currency (just) with $$H(N, V) = 11.44$$, then American dollars with $$H(N, V) =  11.53$$, and finally pre-decimalised British coins with $$H(N, V) =  13.40$$.


Overall pre-decimalised British coins are the least efficient, least available, and most complex of the three currencies compared, justifying my confusion.


# What about Gringotts?

JK Rowling invented quite odd currency denominations [parodying the complexity of pre-decimalised British money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3sd#In_popular_culture).
So I thought I'd also compare this.

+ Wizarding money consists of knuts, sickles, and galleons, with 29 knuts to the sickle, and 17 sickles to the galleon.

In comparison to the other three:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gringotts.png){: .center-image }

This is interesting! Wizarding money requires much more coins (so less efficient), and has a far lower availability than all three other currencies compared.
However it has substantially lower marginal entropies (although a relatively moderate join entropy, $$H(N, V) = 12.12$$).

Why does wizarding money act to differently to the other coins?
There is one major difference between wizarding money and the other three compared here: all denominations of wizarding money are multiples of the others.
The other systems have at least one pair of denominations that are not multiples: dimes and quarters (10¢ and 25¢), 20c and 50c, and a number in old British money, e.g. florins and half crowns (24d and 30d).
This may be one cause of a coinage' complexity.
It could also be a clue if trying to identify between real and fictional currencies.
